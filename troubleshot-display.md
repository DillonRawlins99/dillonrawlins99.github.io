Last weekend I had planned to have a gaming session of Baldur's Gate 3. However my hopes were qualmed when I noticed something peculiar. My journey to the Forgotten Realms would be delayed.

My [ASUS ROG Strix G15](https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-strix/2021-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-series/helpdesk_knowledge/) internal display was completely black. Output to my external display was working however. I could have tabled the issue there and then, but I couldn't resist the temptation to troubleshoot and poke the bear. My search led me to this ASUS support [article](https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1014276/#B2_1), which reccomended software driver updates. No dice. 

I then thought it might be a useful troubleshooting step to use [AMD cleanup utility](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/gpu-601) to do additional driver installation cleanup. The utility requires boot into [Windows Safe Mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode-b90e7808-80b5-a291-d4b8-1a1af602b617#ID0EDD). I restarted the computer in safe mode, but would soon realize my mistake. I no longer had output to an external display likely because safe mode "starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services" was my working hypothesis. My stomach lurched. Now I had lost capability. I did attempt briefly to get the machine to get out of safe mode by using various key sequences but no luck. The machine was likely booting to some kind of startup repair after the multiple interrupted boots and power cycles.

At this point I was pretty dissapointed and emotional, so I took a break. At some point while gathering myself, I saw what could be done to the fundamental display issue. I dissassembled the machine to see if there were obvious connector issues that might have affected the internal display. I have a lack of expertise in this area and my relative lack of skill in electronics troubleshooting and repair left me tentative to do too much. If only I had the knowledge and skill of [Northbridge Fix](https://www.youtube..com/watch?v=3AyTYCYvG2E). I'm out of luck if this fix requires having or using a soldering iron or other specialized tools. I did notice the the the cable from the EDP+LCD Lite, which appears to be some kind of display connector, might have been crunched, but I didn't know what is out of the ordinary in that regard. I knew that things like bad RAM or something were excluded because the machine had been working fine with an external display. In addition, I tried a hard reset technique with a long press of the power button. All troubleshooting steps were unsuccessful. I set aside my attempt to correct the underlying display issue and focused my efforts on recoverability concerns.

I then made it my focus to ensure I recovered the valuable data on my drives and potentially getting the machine back to booting to a regular Windows boot, thus hopefully regaining usage of my external monitor. I bought an [NVME SSD External Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNFH1PX?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and a [512 GB Flash Drive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083ZLJ5MG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to achieve this. With the convenience of Prime 1 day shipping, I was able to continue work the next day. I took out my OS NVME SSD drive as well as my additional data drive I stored mostly games on from the laptop. I used the SSD external adapter and another laptop to grab my valuable data. This experience was a good reminder to up my backup hygiene as Scott Hanselmann reminds us in [The Computer Backup Rule of Three](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/the-computer-backup-rule-of-three). Much of my important data is synced with SAAS or cloud services like on Github, but there were definitely gaps.

Now to attempt to get Windows booting back into regular mode, so I can regain my external display. Using the external  SSD adapter and the extra laptop, I was able to get boot into my Windows OS Drive over USB. One thing I didn't recall is that the laptop shipped with [Bitlocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/), so I had to find my [Bitlocker recovery key](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/finding-your-bitlocker-recovery-key-in-windows-6b71ad27-0b89-ea08-f143-056f5ab347d6). After typing the 48 digit key I booted into "Startup Repair" and tried a couple things. Ultimately I was able to boot into Windows and log on to my user account (after some difficulty as I had primarily used a now disabled pin and had to recall my password). From there I was able to use [msconfig](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/system-configuration-utility-troubleshoot-configuration-errors) to configure Windows to boot regularlly. After verifying I could boot into regular Windows, now for the moment of truth. Would it work on my gaming laptop and give me back external display capability?

I put the OS drive back in the the laptop. After pressing the power button, my fingers were crossed... Mission success! A sigh of relief. While I still very much have my internal display issue, I can at least have usage of my laptop while I pursue support with Asus or some other route. A consolation prize, but still a prize nonetheless (I can play Baldur's Gate on the support phone). Luckily my product is in warranty. Unfortunately, I have not heard much positive sentiment toward Asus customer support and the RMA process, so maybe a local repair shop might be another option if it is a simple fix like a connector issue.

## Conclusion
TODO
## Lesssons Learned
- Don't flail, move in deliberate steps. Consider different approaches if met with a roadblock. Settle for a different solution to a modified problem

- Observation that BIOS menu doesn't show up either (sword swoosh)
